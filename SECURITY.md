# Security Policy

## ⚠️ AI-Generated Code Warning

This SDK was primarily generated by AI and should be used with caution in production environments.

## Security Considerations

### Code Quality
- The code has been generated by AI and may contain issues not caught during initial development
- All code should be thoroughly reviewed before production use
- Additional testing beyond the included test suite is strongly recommended

### Authentication & API Keys
- API key handling should be reviewed for security best practices
- Ensure API keys are stored securely and not committed to version control
- Consider using environment variables or secure key management systems

### Dependencies
- Regular security audits are performed via GitHub Actions
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Keep all dependencies up to date

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to: security@openphone.com
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for response before public disclosure

### Security Best Practices

When using this SDK:

1. **Review all code** before production deployment
2. **Add comprehensive tests** for your specific use cases
3. **Monitor security advisories** for dependencies
4. **Use secure coding practices** when extending the SDK
5. **Keep the SDK updated** to the latest version
6. **Validate all inputs** before making API calls
7. **Implement proper error handling** for production use

### Known Limitations

- Limited human review of AI-generated code
- May not cover all edge cases
- Requires additional testing for production readiness
- Security implications of AI-generated code are not fully understood
